This project explored the ViT algorithm on a dataset set with 62590 images (44048 for training; 18542 for testing). Some researchers used Generative adversarial networks (GAN) and tested the data; the best result was 97%. At the same time, even for ViT the dataset is not big enough, but I still achieved an overall 98% accuracy. And that approved the superior performance in image recognition and classification. All the details and results are on the slide.
